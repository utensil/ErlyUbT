=what's in the test directory=

sorry, I didn't use it as unit tests, instead, it was just some practice in erlang:

First, I learned the most basic usage of gen_tcp, that's gonna be the interface
of my little ubt;

and then, I practiced with gen_udp more extencively than gen_tcp, because it's
gonna be my tool to implement ubt;

after that, I studied 16.1 of Programming Erlang, followed the evolution path of
general server, and played with it a little bit.

The above would be the keystone of my little UbT(UDP based TCP) implementation.
